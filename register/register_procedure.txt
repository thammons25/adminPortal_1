REGISTRATION PROCESS
	-i generate a registration code using sha1( ) with some seed 
		-it gets put into registerCode along with a corresponding id 

	-that code gets emailed to whoever needs an account 

	-they enter that code in the field in /hpgPortal/register/newClientForm.php

	-whatever code they enter gets passed to /hpgPortal/register/checkRegCode.php
		-this page calls upon /hpgPortal/register/validateRegCode.php , which is a function that will attempt to select registerCode( id ) based upon the registerCode( regNum ) they entered 	
			-if it isnt correct it will ask them to try again 
			-if it is correct it will redirect to newLoginForm.php
